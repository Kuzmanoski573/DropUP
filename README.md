# DropUP
🚀 Welcome to my repository "DropUP_site"! 🌟

This repository, "DropUP" represents my inaugural venture at Seavus Education and Development Center, completed on Feb 10, 2023. It marks the transformation of a design project into an NFT marketplace, influenced by the principles of design.

Harnessing the knowledge acquired during the Principhes of design course at the academy, I reimagined the initial design into an immersive online space dedicated to the trade and exhibition of unique digital art—empowering my journey in web development and design excellence.

🎨 Explore the realm of my triumphs and journeys through "DropUP," a meticulously crafted platform meticulously designed to exhibit the boundless creativity enabled by NFTs in the digital art world.

🔧 "DropUP" is meticulously developed using HTML5, CSS3, and cutting-edge design principles, signifying my unwavering commitment to the fusion of technology and artistry in the digital sphere.
